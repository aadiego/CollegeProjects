                       Matt Leacock and published by Z-Man Games
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you have what it takes to save humanity? As a skilled member of a disease-fighting
team, you must keep four deadly diseases at bay while discovering their cures.

You will travel across the globe, treating infections while finding resources for
cures. The clock is ticking as outbreaks and epidemics fuel the spreading plagues.

Can you find all four cures in time? The fate of humanity is in your hands!

In this lite version of Pandemic, you are the solo member of a disease control team.
You must work to develop cures and prevent disease outbreaks, before 4 deadly diseases
(Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) contaminate humanity.
